# PracticeMod



Hey!

I've developed a mod that could help you while practicing in Linkcraft minecraft server with just 1 right click!

## Features

### Commands
- /pm <on|off>

### Keybinds
- "0" is the default keybind, you can change it to whatever keybind that is convenient to you

##  

Once you download the mod, You need to enable it using the command `/pm on` In-game. (Or you can just press the keybind that comes with the mod)

After running `/pm on`, A Rose red dye will spawn in your second hotbar, it won't affect your items in that spot.

**Note**: You cannot use this mod outside Linkcraft server, even in singleplayer!



## Other things that you need to know:

- If your `/pm` command is on and you left the server, it will get switched to off.
- If the Rose red dye disappeared while your `/pm` is on, hover over the second hotbar to make it appear again.
- The Rose red dye is a client side item, meaning you cannot throw it or use it on armor, items or mobs.
